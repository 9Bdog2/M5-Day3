Created CRUD for books 

Middlewares = it is a function 
Functions with a particular signature (req, res, next) => {}
Functions which have access to request and response objects 
They can execute any code 
End the request-response cycle

Middlewares flow 
incoming request => A middleware => Request Handler

error middlewares
are functions 
functions with a particular syntax (error, req, res, next)
the usage is different than normal ones 
error middlewares need to be used after the endpoints
request handlers can send errors to error handlers by using next(error)

try catch 

create file errorHandlers

const errorHandler = (err, req, res, next) =>{
	console.log(err)
	res.status(500).send({message : "Generic server error"})
}


import {errorHandler} from "errorHandlers"

server.use(errorHandler)

 npm i express-validator

create file validation.js

import {body} from "express-validator"

body("firstName").exists().withMessage("First Name is a mandatory field!")
